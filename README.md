#Fomo

##What is Fomo?

Fomo is a bare-minimum version of Antris to demonstrate how simple the system could be and what a true MVP might look like.  
Fomo simply asks where you're going and who to tell when you get there.  
The user is then tracked in the background, using this location information to automatically notify contcts when the user has arrived.  
  
This is slightly different from Antris as it is focussed only on letting people know when you are at an event and does not provide a safety layer if anything goes wrong along the way.  
The plan was to integrate this with Facebook to easily let friends know what you're doing and, more importantly, what they're missing out on.


##Why are you working on this?

The requests for Antris features got completely out of hand - this was a demo of how beautifully simple the solution could potentially be at it's core.
